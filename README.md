# Railway-Reservation-Management-System
The Railway Reservation Management System is a user-friendly application that allows users to search for trains between any two stations based on the day of travel. This system helps users:

View a list of trains between selected origin and destination stations.

Choose a preferred travel day and coach class.

Check seat availability and compare fares across trains.

Select the most optimal train based on price and availability.

This project can be extended into a full end-to-end booking application and can be integrated with third-party platforms like GoIbibo, MakeMyTrip, etc., for a seamless travel booking experience without needing to repeatedly log in to the Indian Railways website.
